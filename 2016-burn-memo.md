#Burn notes for 2016 summer burns
##2016-06-08
* since 12:30, wind speeds up and starts to disturb the balance reading. so there will be some significant noise in the data. however, after shutting down two doors that nearby the burn site, the disturbance became weak.
* during the burn of ec12, cardboard dropped, so it leads to noise of the balance reading
* same issue as ec12 for sn03

* first trial for ec27 didn't propagate, so I tried another ignition on it and it succeeded, but I just took the measurements for the second one

* during the burn of as07, it didn't propagate well
* during the ignition of sn27, wind blowed the ignition source and it didn't touch the plant, thus leads to the relatively longer ignition duration for sn27
* forgot to lap the ignition duration for bi01, thus the combustion duration for bi01 actually includes both ignition and combustion durations.

* bi11: some biomass fell onto the ruler, lead to noise
* as25, as29, bi09, as31, bi07, erc11, bi25, bi19 all showed wired balance reading: the reading jumped back to previous biomass reading and decreased at almost same rate, when it reached certain number, jumped back to previous reading again. When this happened, there was no strong air flow, so i wonder if this is the balance issue.

* no burn notes on this burn

##2016-07-28
* cs25:biomass fell off to ground
* cs09: biomass fell off to ground
* realized that I failed to trigger the hobo logger except the one at 0cm height

##2016-08-03
* apn17: biomass fell off
* cs15r, cs41, cs17r and cs09r biomass fell off
* apn19(test14): this burn was ignited around 50s, but it didn't last due to weak ignition sauce. Thus, it was re-ignited around 92s.
