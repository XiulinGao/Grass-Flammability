#Burn notes for 2016 summer burns
##2016-06-08
* since 12:30, wind speeds up and starts to disturb the balance reading. so there will be some significant noise in the data. however, after shutting down two doors that nearby the burn site, the disturbance became weak.
* during the burn of ec12, cardboard dropped, so it leads to noise of the balance reading
* same issue as ec12 for sn03

* first trial for ec27 didn't propagate, so I tried another ignition on it and it succeeded, but I just took the measurements for the second one

* during the burn of as07, it didn't propagate well
* during the ignition of sn27, wind blowed the ignition source and it didn't touch the plant, thus leads to the relatively longer ignition duration for sn27
* forgot to lap the ignition duration for bi01, thus the combustion duration for bi01 actually includes both ignition and combustion durations.
