# check list for burning steps
#####
- weight all plants without setting up burning, obtain the initial 
weight of pot with plant
- set up light, computer, balance, ruler and trigger sensors. double check
to make sure all sensors are running
- sweep floor to clean up all other stuff 
- put plant on top of balance, turn label toward reader
- set up sensors, adjust sensor height and ruler height
- double check foil on pot is secure enough to protect pot
- take subsample from plant, label it and store in cooler
- take photo of whole plant
- start program on laptop, but keep it at "waiting" stage
- read and record temp, humidity and wind speed, reading of balance
- evenly soak cotton ball with certain amount(10-sec squeeze) of ethanol
  solution, prepare stopwatch on phone
- run program with typing in label for each trial 50s ahead of ignition
- ignite cotton ball, start stopwatch at the same time when plant is
  exposed to cotton ball flame
- lap ignition duration  when seeing solid flame from the plant
- observe burning to catch max. flame height
- remove cotton ball after 30s and trash it in the prepared water
- lap combustion duration and glowing duration
- once burning done (no glowing fuel and fuel cool down to ambient temp), kill program first, then record max. flame height, ignition duration, combustion duration and glowing duration
- collect all the above ground biomass with brush and paper bag, 
label bag with species ID, date, burning trial number
- weight pot again to obtain weight just for pot, dirt and below ground 
biomass, record this weight
- use small size trash bag to wrap pot
- switch between trials
