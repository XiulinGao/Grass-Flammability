# check list for burning steps
#####
- set up light, computer, balance (wrap with foil), ruler and trigger sensors. double check
to make sure all sensors are running
- sweep floor to clean up all other stuff 
- put plant on top of balance, turn label toward reader
- set up sensors, adjust sensor height and ruler height
- double check foil on pot is secure enough to protect pot
- take subsample from plant, label it and store in cooler
- take photo of whole plant
- start program on laptop, but keep it at "waiting" stage
- read and record temp, humidity and wind speed
- evenly soak cotton ball with certain amount(10-sec squeeze) of ethonal
  solution, prepare stopwatch on phone
- run program with typing in label for each trial
- ignite cotton ball, start stopwatch at the same time when plant's
  exposured to cotton ball flame
- lap ignition duration  when seeing solid flame from the plant
- observe burning to catch max. flame height
- remove cotton ball after 30s and trash it in the prepared water
- lap combustion duration and glowing duration
- once burning done (no glowing fuel), kill program first, then record 
  max. flame height, ignition duration, combustion duration and glowing
  duration
- collect all the fuel residuals with brush and paper bag, label bag with
  species ID, date, burning trial number
- carefully move pot to safe place where is no wind and any other disturbance
- use plsatic wrap to wrap pot when it cools down to ambient temp
