# commercially available grass seeds

Field grasses collection can be very expensive regarding gas cost, and it does time limitation on this as well. Therefore, seed collection in the field and buying seeds that available online can be another option for future study. However, this brings other issues, like, greenhouse space and also different growing condition for different species. No mater how, I found some website that will be helpful in the future, which have considerable variety of grass seeds.

   1. [website for searching if target species is commercially available](http://www.cnplx.info/query.html)
   2. following are some website that do have relatively high variety of grass seeds:
     * [Santa Rosa Gardens](http://www.santarosagardens.com/Ornamental-Grasses-Sedges-Grass-s/2.htm), which actually sell whole plant but not seed
     * [Stevenson](http://stevensonintermountainseed.com/devsiseed/?product_cat=grass-and-grass-like-species)
     * [granite seed](http://www.graniteseed.com/products/seeds/grasses-and-grasslike-species)
     * [L&H seeds](http://www.lhseeds.com/grasses-grasslikes/)
     * [Prairie Moon Nursery](https://www.prairiemoon.com/seeds/grasses-sedges-rushes/)
     
As I found, genus like *Agropyron*, *Agrostis*, *Bromus*, *Festuca*, *Bouteloua*, *Elymus*, *Poa*, *Panicum* are common on those websites, but they don't cover a large variety of species under each genus tho. Some of these species they sell we can find in the field easily, so I don't think that's necessary to buy. Later, I will make a list of those species I can buy, as well as I'm interested.
