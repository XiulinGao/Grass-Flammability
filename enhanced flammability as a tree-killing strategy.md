## Are shade-intolerant species more flammable than shade-tolerant species? ##

Assume Yes.

##Project A:comparative study on flammability of shade tolerant and intolerant grass species
###Hypothesis:
1. Shade intolerant grasses are more flammable than shade tolerant species, with enhanced flammability being a strategy to create open area for more light.
2. Plant canopy architecture is an important trait influencing flammability, which here mainly refers to biomass allocation pattern in vertical space.

###Study questions & methods & issues
1. Are shade intolerant species more flammable than shade tolerant species?
A comparative study among 20 grass species will be conducted to answer this question. Flammability data including max. flame height, temperature at 5 different heights(0, 10, 20, 40, 100cm),biomass loss rate will be recorded during each burn trial. In order to calculate total heat produced during each burn, species heat content should be obtained through leaf-scale burn with specific equipment. Issues associated with this part including: species collection in the field; burn trial with tall grass species; equipment availability. 

	For species collection, most shade intolerant species as I listed above are not hard to obtained in the field, as long as it is  a good year. The problem is for shade tolerant species. So, to solve this, collecting plants from greenhouse planting can be an option. Some grass seeds can be obtained from online seed company, for those which can't be obtained online, still need to go to national grassland or BLM or whatever area that has it to collect seeds. If seed planting is the final resolution, large greenhouse space should be the next issue needs to be solved. First option is using department greenhouse, but i have to make a schedule, there may not be possible to get enough plants at once due to their limited room. Another option is paying for using university greenhouse, which only can be done when there is enough fund for this project.
	
	Furthermore, how to create shade growing habitat in greenhouse?

	To solve tall-grass burn issue(biomass easily falls to ground and leads to error in balance data), either figure out better experiment set-up or restrict species collection to short-medium height grass species. 

	For testing species heat content, can look for lab which owns the equipment, fire science associated lab, or engineering and chemistry department. As I searched previous studies, few studies did test grass species heat content, so few data can be obtain from document.

2. Assume flammability varies among different grass species, then What traits lead to this variation?

To answer this, I hypothesize plant canopy architecture which influences biomass allocation in vertical space is an important factor that may lead to variation in grass flammability. 

Canopy architecture relates to biomass partitioning in vertical space, which influences first flammability axis, thus also relates to the influence of grass fire on their woody neighbors and their own reproductive organs. Therefore, questions associated with this trait are:

2.1 how canopy architecture influences heat release at different heights?

2.2. what's the **safe** architecture for grasses regarding the less negative impact the fire will have on grass reproductive organs, but more impacts on woody plants? 

*Note*: As I see during the burn trial, smoldering duration probably is related to surface/volume ration of plant base, which influence how much heat can be transferred into ground to kill reproductive tissue. 

2.3 since grasses architecture will change significantly after they are senescent or at significantly different water content level (such as under severe water deficit), so at what moisture content when architecture is not important for fire propagation anymore (but I think fuel load will then play an important role, as well surface/volume ratio?)? 

*Note*: As I see, some grasses can keep most of their dead biomass being held above the ground but some species keep most dead biomass being concentrated near the ground, which I think may influence flammability and heat that transferred into ground. But since I don't think there is significant difference in fuel moisture content when grasses are senescent, then I will think this post-senescence architecture difference may due to certain chemicals content difference, such as lignin. 

Biomass allocation in vertical space is assessed as biomass density which has been measured in a novel way provided by Ripley et al.([2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/14-1495.1/full)). This measurement reflects how compact the fuel is in vertical space, thus may influence fire spread rate in vertical space and heat release at different heights. According to the 'pyrogenicity as protection' hypothesis proposed by Gagnon et al. ([2010](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/10-0291.1/abstract)), if plants retain fuel off ground and burn rapidly, enhanced flammability will protect under-ground organs and propagules.

But, this measurement just assessed how fuel allocated along height, which is one dimension. However, it's surface to volume ratio that influence how aerated fuel is, thus fire spread rate. Thus, **is this enough to assess how fire residence time in vertical space?** Or I need to combine this with surface to volume ratio?
 
1) Is there any relation between max. soil temperature and the height at which the plant reaches its maximum biomass density(assumed that **0** ~ **-10** cm soil temperature vary significantly among species)?
 
2) What's the safe height where a large amount of biomass is concentrated?

Issue associated with this part of research is how to accurately measure plant canopy architecture. Canopy architecture measurement is usually based on geometry assumption of the canopy shape. However, when plants are dead and dry(usually during fire season in spring), their canopy shape vary differently which can't be assumed as a simple geometry shape. 

Possible resolution: 3D image analysis? high cost

###Estimated term of project and schedule

##Project B: model building

###Project goal

Based on project A, I aim to build model to predict grass flammability with plant traits being model input. I will mainly focus on 1) if plant biomass allocation pattern in vertical space influence heat generated in vertical space and how. 2) if plant height influences max. flame height and how. 3) if canopy architecture or plant surface to volume ratio influence max. biomass loss rate. 4) if max. flame height is associated with max. biomass loss rate. 5) if biomass concentrate at 0~10cm or surface/volume ratio at 0~10cm influences smoldering duration and heat at soil surface. 6) based on all those questions being solved, build a model to predict grass flammability and thus assess what type of canopy architecture benefits plants with enhanced 
flammability.

###Methods & Issues

Need detailed measurements in plant canopy architecture traits, plant surface/volume ratio, and solid flammability measurements of each species. With all needed data well collected, modeling process is required to accomplish the goal. Project A can be a preliminary study for project B.

Issue: **need a more accurate way to measure plant canopy architecture traits**

###Estimated term of project and schedule


##Project C: greenhouse experiment for testing accuracy of shade tolerance classification of study species

###Project goal
Due to limited documentation of shade tolerance characteristic of study species, this part is mainly aimed to test the shade tolerance classification of study species, and try to document the results. The project will help me have a better understand in the relationship between
grass shade tolerance and enhanced flammability with providing a potential correction to the data analysis and conclusion formation. It also  benefits future research which may need this information. 


###Methods

1. greenhouse experiment: seeds of study species will be collected and geminated under proper condition(details on this should be obtained from
seed company or expert rancher). When the first true leaves appeared, seedlings will be randomly assigned to three different levels of light supply: low, medium and high, which will be chosen on the average photon density of growing season in study area. 5 replicates per treatment per species. No nutrition treatments, since I don't want to detect potential light X nutrients interactive effects.

The whole growing process under different treatment will last to the end of growing season, and data collected during the process will include:
 





##Project D: Can grasses possessing enhanced flammability kill their woody neighbors?

To determine if enhanced flammability possessed by some grass species is detrimental for co-existing woody species, which can be assessed by determining where the most heat will be.

2.1 Down into soil?

This situation is not beneficial for grasses at all, reproductive organ and propagules probably will be killed. 

2.2 Upward into the upper space?

In this situation, most heat will go to above-ground biomass, of either grasses or woody species, result in death or scorch of above-ground biomass. 

Either way, questions needed to solve include:

1) Temperature below ground at 0 -- -10 cm, as well as temperature at different heights in upper space. 

2) Is this temperature profile related to biomass allocation pattern in vertical space? 

3) What's the influence of max. soil temperature on regrowth of grasses?

4) How is mortality or scorch of woody species? any relation between the damage of woody species and flammability measurements (max. flame height, temp at different heights, max. heat release rate), as well as biomass allocation? 


### Chemical traits ###

Some plant secondary compounds such as terpenes are very flammable. Recently, more studies started to investigate the influence of plant chemicals on woody species flammability ([Pausas et al., 2016](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-015-3454-8); [Elena Ormeño et al., 2009](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112708007020)). In common with other plants, grasses also produce a large array of secondary compounds, which often associated with the interaction between grass species and their biotic environment. Many of these secondary compounds are toxicants that influence forage quality or stress herbivore. Some of these compounds are important allelochemicals involved in stimulation or inhibition of growth of co-existing neighbors. As reviewed by Gibson ([2009](http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300127449)), there are mainly four classes of secondary compounds in grasses considering their ecological impotence: nitrogen compounds, terpenoids, phenolics and others. For instance, a variety of monoterpenes are reported in emissions from grassland vegetation, for instance, α- and β-pinene, myrcene and limonene from *Poa* spp. dominated grassland in the Midwestern USA ([Fukui and Doskey, 2000](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231000000686?np=y.) ). However, some of those compounds are not widespread in grasses.
 
*Note*: I think this aspect can be combined with invader grass species which may replace native species by inhibiting their growth, especially when this is associated with allelochemicals generated by invaders. 
 
Except secondary compounds, chemicals like C:N, lignin, silicon, phosphate also can influence flammability.

So, questions are: 

1) Whether tested chemicals vary significantly in content among various grass species? Assume yes
 
2) Do tested chemicals influence flammability of tested plants? Assume yes

3) Do chemicals inhibit neighbors growth? 
 
4) Do chemicals defend herbivore attack? If so, will reduce in herbivore intensity or exclusion of herbivore influence flammability among the same grass species? 

5) Do chemicals (like lignin and C:N) influence dead biomass decomposition rate and how? 
 
6) Will decomposition influence chemicals variety and amount? If so, do altered chemical variety and amount in turn influence flammability? 
    
7) Is there any relation between chemicals(such as lignin, silicon) and plant architecture after plant is senescent? If so, will certain chemicals change significantly after plant senescence, thus alter architecture and flammability at different plant life stage? Also, will this change in architecture lead to flammability variation among various senescent grasses?
