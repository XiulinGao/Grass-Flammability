##A:a comparative study on 20 species in flammability
###Key question:

 Are shade-intolerant grasses more flammable than shade-tolerant grasses in terms of heat generated during burn(-10~10cm, above 10cm) and max. flame height.

##B: Modeling of grass flammability

1. Does biomass allocation in vertical space influence heat generate at different height and flame height?
2. Does SAV of grass base influence its smoldering time? does total biomass or/and SAV at 0~10cm plant height influence heat generated at -10cm and 0cm ? 
3. Does leaf SAV influence flame height? 
4. How moisture content varied across studied species in fire season? What's the influence on flammability?
5. Does SAV influence water retention of studied species? 
6. Does shade-intolerant species have similar plant architecture? What's the safe plant architecture for a highly flammable grass in terms of the ecological influence of enhanced flammability ? # light availability may shape shade-intolerant plants architecture ?
7. what's the heat content of studied species? 
8.  More?

##C: Greenhouse experiment to document shade tolerance characteristic of studied species

##D: Field prescribed burns to detect the ecological influence of enhanced flammability of studied species on their co-existing woody species in the ecosystem. 

##E:  Ecosystem influence on flammability of highly flammable grasses.

Will highly flammable grasses burn in similar way in different ecosystem?
