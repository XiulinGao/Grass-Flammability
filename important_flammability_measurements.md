# Important flammability measurements  for testing tree-killing hypothesis and traits influencing them

* maximum flame height, which determines the scorch height of co-existing trees, thus has direct effect. The plant trait that potentially influence max. flame height a grass fuel can produce, I think, can be:

     1. plant height where 90% biomass concentrate
     2. chemical content, if it does exist
     
*Note*: 

 1. However, previous work ( [Dupuy, 2003](http://www.sciencedirect.com.lib-e2.lib.ttu.edu/science/article/pii/S0010218003001470?) ) found max. flame height covariates with peak mass loss rate, and it only depends on max. heat release rate. Thus, plant traits that influence peak mass loss rate also can influence max. flame height, such as biomass,      
 2. Will average flame height of fully developed flame be more meaningful than max. flame height when consider how a grass fire damage co-existing trees? Since whether the fire can lead to scorch of the tree not only depends on flame height, but also depends on how long this considerable flame height can last.
 
* total heat released, which determines how much heat can be transferred to trees
     1. total above-ground biomass
     2. fuel moisture content, which is important for fresh biomass, determines the portion of biomass that combusted
     
* smoldering duration, which has more influence on underground plant organs
     1. fuel moisture content?
     2. fuel decomposition rate, which will influence the amount of duff that concentrate at the base. But this is more a point that needed to be considered in community level?
