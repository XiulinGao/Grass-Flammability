# Trait measurement method
############
I will collect grass traits including plant moisture content, biomass density,
tiller density, leaf dry mass per area (LMA), plant height and width, fuel bulk
density and surface area to volume ratio before burning.
############
## Moisture content, LMA and leaf thickness
############ 
Subsample per individual will be collected, weighted and scanned to obtain fresh
weight and leaf area.Then all subsamples will be oven-dried at 60â„ƒ  for 48 hours
and weighted to obtain fuel moisture content(FMC) and LMA. Leaf thickness is 
measured by using caliper with high accuracy. FMC is calculated as ratio of 
water weight to fuel dry mass. LMA is calculated as ratio of leaf dry
mass to leaf area.
############
For grass species with needle leaves, leaf area is measured by taking two 
diameters of needle which perpendiculate to each other, and needle length.
Leaf thickness is defined as the narrowest diameter.
############
## Biomass density
########### 
Grass above ground part will be divided into 5 equal intervals along  height, 
each part will be weighted. Biomass density is determined by dividing the
accumulative biomass by accumulative plant height, which will provide
information about distribution of  plant biomass in vertical space. This 
measurement will just be taken on destroyed plants.
############
## Tiller density
############ 
Tiller density will be obtained by counting number of tillers and taking
basal area by using measuring grid paper after plant burned or cut. Tiller
density is determined by dividing tiller number by basal area.
############ 
## Plant height, width and thickness
########### 
I will measure two kinds of plant height:
1) the shortest distance from grass base to highest point. 
2) the shortest distance from grass base to the boundary where 90% biomass 
concentrates.
###########
Grass will be classified into three parts: bunch, stalk and inflorence.
Bunch is defined as the leafy basal part, however, for grass without leafy
bunch, I will classified them into only stalk and inflorence. Stalk is defined 
as the first order of branch. Inflorence is defined as the second or higher 
orders of branch. Width and thickness are measured by taking 2 diameters
perpendicular to each other three times for each part. The major diameter 
will be taken as plant width and the minor diameter will be taken as thickness.
Length of each part is also measured and recorded.
###########
## Bulk density
###########
Fuel bulk density is calculated as ratio of fuel dry mass to fuel volume. Fuel
volume can be estimated as the product of length, width and thickness of 
each part, total plant volume will be the sum of volume of each part weighted
by corresponding length.
###########
## Surface area to volume ratio
###########
Surface area will be determined by sum of surface area of each part weighted by
length.
##########
Measurements for each part probably will be different from the plan, I will
make decision depend on the specific geometry of each part. However, for same
speccies, I will keep this straight. More details will be correct for this 
part later.
